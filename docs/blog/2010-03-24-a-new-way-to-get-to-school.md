# A new way to get to school

I was very envy my classmates who have a motorcycle, because I had to go to school on foot in the beginning of college. Although my dormitory is not very far away from school, you still need to climb the mountain to arrive there. I really want a new way that riding a motorcycle to school.  
  
However,I didn't have a driver's license, let alone ask my father to give a motorcycle to me. In fact, my mother objects me taking the exam of driver's license because of the risk of car accident. First, I have to keep it a secret before getting a driver's license by myself. If I didn't do so, I would absolutely be stopped by my mom. Second, I asked my classmates who had passed the exam the experiment of the exam. I didn't know how to pass the exam so that I had to ask more information about the exam to decrease the difficulty of the exam. Third, I borrowed a motorcycle from my classmate and practiced for the road test of the exam. My mom kept the motorcycle from me in order not to let me practice riding it. So I have to practice before I go to the exam. Forth, watch the testbook of the exam to practice for the writting test of the exam. The questions of the test will be written from the test book.  
  
Fortunately, I pass the exam in the first time to take it. Thus, I made a daring desicion. I deside to ride the motorcycle, which my parents bought eleven years ago, from Changhua to Miaoli without my parents permission. It took me three hours to arrive Miaoli. I even lost my way to Miaoli. Obviously, My parents were very angry about it.
